# GitHub Pages Alternative Setup

## ⚠️ Important: GitHub Pages Limitations

GitHub Pages **cannot host your full XSD Editor app** because:
- ❌ No backend support (Node.js/Express server needed)
- ❌ No environment variables (needed for API configuration)
- ❌ Static files only (your app needs dynamic API calls)

## 🎯 Recommended Approach: Netlify + Railway

Your app is already configured for the **best deployment setup**:
- **Frontend**: Netlify (free, supports environment variables, builds)
- **Backend**: Railway (free tier, supports Node.js)

Follow `QUICK_DEPLOYMENT.md` for the 10-minute setup.

## 🔧 If You Still Want to Try GitHub Pages (Frontend Only)

**Note**: This will deploy only the React frontend without backend functionality.

### Setup Steps:

1. **Create GitHub Pages build script** in `client/package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "predeploy": "npm run build",
       "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
       "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Install gh-pages**:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

3. **Build and deploy**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

### ❌ What Won't Work:
- File upload functionality
- XSD parsing and generation
- Any server-side features
- API calls to backend

### ✅ What Will Work:
- Static React components
- Client-side JavaScript
- Basic UI navigation

## 🚀 Better Alternative: Use the Full Setup

The complete setup in `QUICK_DEPLOYMENT.md` gives you:
- ✅ Full functionality
- ✅ File uploads and processing  
- ✅ XSD parsing and generation
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ Free hosting for both frontend and backend
- ✅ Automatic deployments from Git
- ✅ HTTPS and custom domains

**Deployment time**: ~10 minutes
**Cost**: Free for personal projects
