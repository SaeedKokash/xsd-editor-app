# üîß API URL Fix - Render Backend Integration

## ‚úÖ Issue Identified and Fixed:

The problem was that Axios was not properly using the full base URL, even though the environment variable was correctly set. The request was going to a relative path `/api/xsd/upload` instead of the full URL `https://xsd-editor-app.onrender.com/api/xsd/upload`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Changes Made:

### 1. **Created Axios Instance with Proper Configuration**
- Instead of using the global `axios` object, created a dedicated `apiClient` instance
- Set `baseURL` property correctly on the instance
- Added request interceptor for better debugging

### 2. **Updated All API Functions**
- Changed all API calls to use `apiClient` instead of `axios`
- Updated paths to be relative (e.g., `/xsd/upload` instead of `${API_BASE_URL}/xsd/upload`)

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added request interceptor to log the actual URLs being called
- This will help verify that requests are going to the correct Render backend

## üöÄ Next Steps:

1. **Push the changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix API client to use proper baseURL for Render backend"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Netlify will auto-deploy** with the fixed API configuration

3. **Test the upload functionality** and check browser console for the new debug logs

## üîç Debug Information:

You should now see logs like this in the browser console:
```
API Configuration: {
  REACT_APP_API_URL: 'https://xsd-editor-app.onrender.com/api',
  API_BASE_URL: 'https://xsd-editor-app.onrender.com/api',
  NODE_ENV: 'production'
}

API Request: {
  method: 'POST',
  url: '/xsd/upload',
  baseURL: 'https://xsd-editor-app.onrender.com/api',
  fullURL: 'https://xsd-editor-app.onrender.com/api/xsd/upload'
}
```

## üö® If Still Not Working:

1. **Check your Render backend**:
   - Make sure it's deployed and running
   - Test the API directly: `https://xsd-editor-app.onrender.com/api/health`

2. **Check CORS settings** on your Render backend:
   - Ensure `CORS_ORIGIN` includes your Netlify URL
   - Should be: `https://your-app.netlify.app`

3. **Verify the API endpoint** exists on your backend:
   - Check that `/api/xsd/upload` route is properly configured

## üéØ Expected Result:

After this fix, your XSD upload should work correctly with the Render backend! The axios instance will properly construct the full URL and send requests to your Render deployment.
